NOT DONE
--------
1. Add some basic SSPP theory as in Smith and Brown's work

2. Incoroporate supplementary material - in other words put in all the derivation of the VB filter.

3. Confirm in some way the model estimation on real data. We can do this by either
   a. Developing a marginalised PF OR
   b. Do KS tests of results
If the KS results do not come out that good we will opt  for the marginalised PF which will, more likely than not, corroborate the results of the VB filter.

4. Spend some time to try find more real data. Two applications will look better than one.

5. I will organise a Git repo and put everything on it. It is a great way to share and for people to jointly write a work without having several versions running around. We will also put up the code for the same reason.
